# authenticationNumber-1
This is my first project that I have started working on seriously. And my goal is only Backend work. The programming language I used is PHP. This is an authentication page: registration and login. But I tried to write the code a little standard. But there is still a long way to be completely standardized.
Here I have used a ready-made template

Authentication System with PHP and Database:

This project is a simple authentication system that stores user information using PHP and a database and performs the authentication process based on user email addresses. This project helps you implement a user registration and login system using PHP and MySQL.

Key features of the project:

User Registration: Users can register in the system by entering required information such as name, email, and password. The registration information is stored in the database.

User Login: Users can log into the system using their email and password. The system verifies the entered information and grants access to the user accordingly.

Access Restrictions: You can define the need for user login for specific sections of the system. This way, users will only have access to restricted areas after logging into the system.

User Management: If needed, you can create a user management section to view and manage user information. This section can include features such as editing, deleting, and searching for users.

The authentication system with PHP and a database can serve as a foundation for developing larger and more complex systems. Depending on your needs, you can expand this project and add more features to it.
